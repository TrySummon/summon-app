**Your All-in-One Desktop App for Designing, Building, and Testing Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers & AI Agents.**

---

The main Summon features are:

| Features | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OpenAPI Integration** | Import OpenAPI (v3) specifications and visually select endpoints to include in your MCP server. Combine multiple APIs into a single, cohesive server. |
| **MCP Server Generation** | Generate complete, runnable Node.js MCP server projects with one click. Configure authentication and manage servers directly from the GUI. |
| **External MCP Support** | Connect to any existing MCP server (local or remote) via `mcp.json` configuration. Support for CLI-based servers with automatic tool discovery. |
| **AI Playground** | Test MCP tools in an interactive chat interface with multiple AI models including OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Azure OpenAI. |
| **Live Tool Editing** | Modify tool names, descriptions, and input schemas on the fly without restarting servers. View diffs of your modifications in real-time. |
| **Secure Credentials** | Store API keys and tokens safely using system keychain services. All credentials managed locally with secure authentication for AI providers and APIs. |
