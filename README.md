**Your All-in-One Desktop App for Designing, Building, and Testing Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers & AI Agents.**

---

Summon streamlines the development workflow for AI agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It empowers developers to:

* **Generate MCP servers** from one or more OpenAPI specifications.
* **Run and manage** these generated servers locally.
* **Connect to external MCP servers**.
* **Test and iterate** on tools within an interactive AI Playground, with the ability to **edit tool definitions on the fly**.
